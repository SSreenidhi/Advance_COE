            "2.  **Handle the Number 2:** The number 2 is the smallest and only even prime number. We handle it as a special case to return `True` right away.\n",
            "3.  **Eliminate All Other Even Numbers:** If a number is even and isn't 2, it's divisible by 2. Therefore, it cannot be prime. This check (`n % 2 == 0`) quickly eliminates about half of all possible inputs.\n",
            "4.  **Iterate up to the Square Root:**\n",
            "    *   We don't need to check for divisors all the way up to `n`. If a number `n` has a divisor `a`, then `n = a * b`. If `a` is greater than the square root of `n`, then `b` must be smaller.\n",
            "    *   This means we only need to find one of the divisors, and we are guaranteed to find one that is less than or equal to the square root of `n`.\n",
            "    *   The condition `i * i <= n` is a fast way to check if `i <= sqrt(n)` without using floating-point math.\n",
            "5.  **Check Only Odd Divisors:** Since we've already eliminated all even numbers, we don't need to check for even divisors (like 4, 6, 8, etc.). We can start our check at `i = 3` and increment by 2 in each step (`i += 2`), checking only 3, 5, 7, 9, and so on.\n",
            "6.  **Return `True`:** If the loop finishes without finding any divisors, it means the number is not divisible by any number other than 1 and itself, making it a prime number.\n",
